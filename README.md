# goGPS 1.0 Open Edition

_Welcome to the goGPS wiki pages, here we will try to write useful information for users and developers._

**goGPS** is a software created for processing GNSS raw data. It was originally written specifically to work with GPS single-frequency low-cost receivers but now it can fully exploit **multi-constellation**, **multi-frequency**, **multi-tracking** observations. goGPS implements multiple algorithms to analyze the data, and at the moment these include two main Least Squares (LS) engines: one working on combination of observables (e.g. iono-free observations) and one able to use all the frequencies and trackings logged without performing any combinations (ionospheric delay are parameters of the normal equations).
The **combined and uncombined engines** can both compute Precise Point Positioning (PPP) solutions and Network adjustments (NET).

**Note:** At the moment the software is focused on the processing of permanent stations (geodetic or low-cost) but it does not yet include the possibility to analyze moving receivers.

### Coding goGPS
For a bit old presentation on the goGPS coding have a look at this presentation:
